. The BRX dongle will exit the menu automatically.

== Advance config via the BLE Web interface

BRX dongle custom mappings can be configured via the BLE Web config. This interface allows you to configure a few extra settings from a phone or Bluetooth-capable PC.

* Visit this address and click the "Connect BRX" button to open a Bluetooth device pairing menu. Select the BRX from the device list and click "Pair" to access to configuration menu.
  https://darthcloud.github.io/brxWebCfg/
* Note: If the Bluetooth device pairing menu does not open and you are using a Chromium-based browser, open a new browser tab and enter `chrome://flags`, search for "Web Bluetooth API", and set the option to Enabled. At this time, it appears that Firefox does not have an option to access Bluetooth devices.

Up to 48 mappings can be added in each mapping bank. Simply click on +/- buttons to add or remove a mapping. You can use the Src label to select the actual BT controller type you are currently using. The labels selection is only to help you make the mapping selection and has no effect on the config otherwise.

The "Select mapping bank" drop-down menu lets you select the active mapping bank for which the setting will be saved to. You need to save for each modified device mapping setting.

For each mapping, you can configure various options which may or may not be used based on what the source and destination for a button or an axis are and vice versa.

If all you want to do is a simple button remapping, all you need to touch is the Src and Dest columns. Leave everything else as the default value.

* Src: This is the source button/axis on the Bluetooth controller
* Dest: This is the destination button/axis on the wired interface.
* Max: If source & destination is an axis, then this is the scaling factor based on the destination maximum. +
If source is a button & destination is an axis, then this is the value based on destination axis maximum.
* Threshold: If source is an axis and destination is a button, this is the threshold required on the source axis before the button is pressed.
* Deadzone: This is the axis dead zone around the reset value.
* Turbo: Turbo function based on the system frame rate.

== BRX dongle button usages

After you powered the system on, you can use the button on the BRX dongle as follow:

* Quick press: Bluetooth controller is disconnected from the BRX dongle.
* 3 seconds press: The BRX dongle config is reset to default.

== Firmware Update over Wi-Fi

. Turn your Xbox console off.
. Connect the BRX dongle into one of the controller slots.
. Hold the BRX dongle button and simultaneously power on the Xbox console. Once the power is on, release the BRX dongle button.
. The LED on the dongle will be solid ON and do two quick OFF blinks every second, indicating it is attempting to connect to Wi-Fi.
. If Wi-Fi is configured already, skip to step 10.
. If Wi-Fi is not yet configured on the BRX dongle, the adapter will stay in the blinking state until you configure it.
. Install the Espressif "Soft-AP" provisioning App on your phone. +
Apple: https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/esp-softap-provisioning/id1474040630 +
Android: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-provisioning-android/releases
. Scan the following QR code within the Espressif App. +
image:static/xbox_qr_code.png[]
. Once the app is connected to the dongle, select the Wi-Fi Network you want to connect to and enter the password for the network.
. Once connected, the LED pattern will change to two quick ON blinks every second.
. Once completed, the dongle will reboot and the LED will be pulsing to indicate it's in Bluetooth paring mode.

== Factory reset

. Turn your Xbox console off.
. Connect the BRX dongle into one of the controller slots.
. Hold the BRX dongle button and simultaneously power on the Xbox console. Keep holding the button for around 8 seconds and then release it.
. Once done, the dongle will reboot and the LED will be pulsing to indicate it's in Bluetooth paring mode.

== Updating the Wi-Fi configuration for FW update

* After 5 failed Wi-Fi connection attempts, the Wi-Fi settings will be reset and will be reconfigurable via the Espressif app.
* Alternatively, you can also factory reset the BRX adapter.

== I don't want to/can't use either of the phone apps.

It's possible to configure the Wi-Fi using a PC with Wi-Fi and a python script.

*DOCS TBD*

== I don't want to/can't let the dongle access the Internet

It's possible to configure the Wi-Fi using a PC with Wi-Fi and a python script and to set a local web server.

*DOCS TBD*

== Support BRX with linux's xpad driver

. Disconnect BRX dongle from PC.
. Create a file named `/etc/udev/rules.d/98-brx.rules` and add the following content to it:
+
----
ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="303A", ATTRS{idProduct}=="81EB", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe xpad" RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 303A 81EB > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/xpad/new_id'"
----

. Run `sudo udevadm control --reload`
. Connect adapter to PC. It should now be using the xpad driver.
